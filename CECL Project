Introduction of credit loss automation reporting tool 
Note: Due to the credential agreements Purdue University student team had signed
with their business partner, the actual automation reporting tool, the imported data,
and the Excel VBA code will not be shared in the Github. However, the following text
description and screenshot provide an general introduction of the functionality of
the tool.

1. Overall tool design logic: 
Enable the end users to import 2 files, “solvas out” and “snapshot” data to Excel.
The tool will first automatically calculate the credit loss rate of individual loans,
based on historical accounting data (“solvas out”). Consequently, the loans will be
grouped into several segments, based on the accounting standard and the bank
management’s professional judgement. Lastly, the credit loss rate calculated for
different portfolio segments will be applied to the historical data(“snapshot”) again
to calculate and predict the credit loss of each segment in the next period.
 
2. Tools screenshot:

a. Excel template
There are two buttons written with Excel VBA included in the tool. The reporters will
be able to easily import the “solvas out” and “snapshot” data into the tools. After that,
the calculated ECL (estimated credit loss) and the corresponding charts will be
automatically calculated and summarized in this sheet.  
 
b. Python template:
Due to the large dataset, the risk management team also write a python version of the
tool to speed up the running time of the tool. Similarly, the python version of
automation tool will import data from the users’ designated file path, calculate the
credit loss of next period, and generate the corresponding charts with the same logic.

Python output (1)- Calculated credit loss:  
Bank Branch A 
Bank Branch B 
Bank Branch C 
Python output (2)- Calculated credit loss:
